## My process

### Built with
Vanilla HTML & CSS. As I found that this basic stack has the tools to do form validation on client-side, I chose not to use javascript. 


### What I learned
I expected an easy challenge as I already practiced this kind of form validation with the “Ping coming soon Landing Page” challenge. But it turned out it was actually quite a challenge and I had the chance to practice a lot of different things! 
I find that positioning background images is never easy. I tried a little trick with the one on desktop and with `calc` and `max` css functions. 
I used flexbox and the `order` property for positioning sections in a different order on mobile and desktop. I used grid for styling the form element on tablet and desktop. 


### Questions to community
No questions in particular, except maybe on the subject of modifying the color of svg elements without having to copy paste the whole svg code into html markup in order to access the `fill` property with css, that I find cumbersome : do you have any resources on the subject that could enlighten me. 
Also, I did get through quickly on the matter of styling the background image on mobile view and did not quite matched the expected design with my use of `background-blend-mode` property. Any advice on that part ?


### Continued development
I need to dive deeper or to dive at all on the subject of embedding svg in html document and what I can do and can't do this way.
